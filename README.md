# Ultimate History

The aim of this project is collaborating in the creation of high quality, free and open source Anki decks on the topic of human history.

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is open-source [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) software available for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS. Check the [Anki installations instructions](https://apps.ankiweb.net/#downloads). Spaced repetition is an improvement over classic _flashcards_ that allows for more flexible and efficient learning.

The underlying idea of this project is to view history as a **graph of events and people** who are connected. The Anki cards not only query you about individual events and people but also about the **relationships** between them.
